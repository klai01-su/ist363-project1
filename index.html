        Spectre is a lightweight, modern and  
        responsive CSS framework. It solves  
        many problems what we had once like  
        the cross-browser compatibility issue.  
        These days the websites are perfect  
        for all the browsers (IE, Firefox,  
        and Chrome) and for all sizes of  
        screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets,  
        and Phones).
